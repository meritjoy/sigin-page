# UI/UX Design Assignment

## Task 1

**In your own understanding, explain UI and UX, using a real-life example.**

---

### UX (User Experience):
This involves how a user feels when using the product — whether it’s easy, smooth, frustrating, or confusing. It's about the **overall experience**.

**Example: Mobile Phone**

- How fast and smooth the phone responds to touch.
- How easy it is to navigate between apps.
- Whether the phone feels intuitive or takes effort to figure out.

---

### UI (User Interface):
This refers to the **visual elements and interactive components** that a user sees and interacts with on a device or app.

**Example: Mobile App**

- The icons, buttons, color schemes, text fonts, and layouts on the home screen app.
- The design of the keyboard, the look of the notifications, and how the menu is structured.
